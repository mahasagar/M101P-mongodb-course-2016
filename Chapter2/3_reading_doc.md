#Reading Docs : query language
 - db.movieDetails.find({rated : "PG-13"}).count() : to find the data in movieDetails collections
 - db.movieDetails.find({rated : "PG-13",year:2009}).count() : to find the data in movieDetails collections with multiple query
 - db.movieDetails.find({"address.district":"Pune"}) : to get data using nested filed.
    - using dot notation
    - put query in " "
 - Equality Matches on Arrays
   - On the Entire Array
   - Based on Any Element
   - Based on Specific Element
   - More Complex Matches using Operators
 - db.movieDetails.find({"writers":["sagar","amol"]}).count()
   - it checks the order and element present in array..!
 - if we want to match any one element in array we can use
   - db.movieDetails.find({"actors":"Jeff Bridges"});
 - to find the name which occur first in array
   - db.movieDetails.find({"actors.0":"Jeff Bridges"}).pretty()

 - Cursors
  - find method returns a cursor
  - it automatically iterate around for 20 times.
  - mongodb server returns data in batches
  - batch size will not go beyond 1 MB or BSON Doc size
  - type "it" to iterate
    - var c = db.movieDetails.find()
    - var doc = function(){return c.hasNext() ? c.next():null;}
    - c.objsLeftInBatch();
    - iterate using doc();

 - Projections
    - reduce the data returning from find()
    - its second argument to find()
    - projection : include only those field which are specified.
    - db.movieDetails.find({rated:"PG"},{title:1}).pretty()
    - db.movieDetails.find({rated:"PG"},{title:1,_id:0}).pretty()
