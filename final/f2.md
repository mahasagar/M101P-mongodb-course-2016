Please use the Enron dataset you imported for the previous problem. For this question you will use the aggregation framework to figure out pairs of people that tend to communicate a lot. To do this, you will need to unwind the To list for each message.

This problem is a little tricky because a recipient may appear more than once in the To list for a message. You will need to fix that in a stage of the aggregation before doing your grouping and counting of (sender, recipient) pairs.

Which pair of people have the greatest number of messages in the dataset?



db.messages.aggregate([
{
 $project: {
 from: "$headers.From",
 to: "$headers.To"
}
},
{
 $unwind: "$to"
},
{
 $group : { _id : { _id: "$_id", from: "$from", to: "$to" }
}
},
{
 $group : { _id : { from: "$_id.from", to: "$_id.to" }, count: {$sum :1}
}
},
{
 $sort : {count:-1}
},
{
 $limit: 2
}
])
