#Final: Question 6

Suppose you have a collection of students of the following form:

{
    "_id" : ObjectId("50c598f582094fb5f92efb96"),
    "first_name" : "John",
    "last_name" : "Doe",
    "date_of_admission" : ISODate("2010-02-21T05:00:00Z"),
    "residence_hall" : "Fairweather",
    "has_car" : true,
    "student_id" : "2348023902",
    "current_classes" : [
        "His343",
        "Math234",
        "Phy123",
        "Art232"
    ]
}
Now suppose that basic inserts into the collection, which only include the last name, first name and student_id, are too slow (we can't do enough of them per second from our program). What could potentially improve the speed of inserts? Check all that apply.

#Answer :
Remove all indexes from the collection, leaving only the index on _id in place
Set w=0, j=0 on writes
